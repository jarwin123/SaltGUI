Branch zzz-externaldoc
("zzz" to move it to the bottom of the list)
PoC for accessing Salt documentation from the SaltStack website.
See https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/

PRO:
* the online documentation is nicer to read

CON:
* documentation can already be requested
* the external documentation may not be matching the current version that is in use
  otoh: in systems with different minion versions, that may already be the case

VERDICT:
Keep until there is an actual request for it
